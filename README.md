# 🚀 About
Codember is a week of challenges, tricks, and secrets created by Midudev for the community where each week of November, a new challenge is released that challenges our programming logic, wit, and curiosity. 
These challenges can be solved in any programming language. In my case, I solve them using Python and JavaScript since they are my preferred languages.
